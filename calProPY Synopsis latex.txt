\section{Introduction}
This synopsis presents a Python project that implements a calculator application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library. The project focuses on creating a user-friendly and functional calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations.

\section{Objective}
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a calculator with a graphical user interface using Python and Tkinter.
    \item Implement basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    \item Provide a clear cuser interface for input and displaying results.

        \label{fig:enter-label}
    \end{figure}
    \item Enhance user experience by incorporating user-friendly design and functionality.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
The project will be implemented using the following methodology:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Python Programming:} Python will be used for the core logic of the calculator.
    \item \textbf{Tkinter Library:} Tkinter will be utilized to create the graphical user interface for the calculator.
    \item \textbf{UI Design:} The calculator's user interface will prioritize user experience, making it easy to use and visually appealing.
    \item \textbf{Arithmetic Operations:} Basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, will be implemented in the Python code.
    \item \textbf{Event Handling:} Event handling will be used to capture user input and perform calculations based on the user's selections.
\end{itemize}

\section{Features}
The calculator will include the following features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Buttons for digits 0-9.
    \item Buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    \item Buttons for other operations like square root and percentage.
    \item Buttons for memory functions (save, retrieve, clear, add, and subtract).
    \item A clear button to reset the input.
    \item An equals (=) button to calculate the result.
    \item A display area to show the input and the calculated result.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
By the completion of this project, a fully functional calculator with a user-friendly graphical user interface will be created. This calculator will be capable of performing basic arithmetic operations and will provide an intuitive user experience.
